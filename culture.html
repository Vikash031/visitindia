          <div class="container text-left">India’s culture is a rich tapestry woven from thousands of years of history, diverse traditions, and a multitude of influences. Here’s an in-depth look at the various aspects that make Indian culture unique and vibrant:

            Religious Diversity<br>
            India is the birthplace of major world religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. These religions have shaped the country’s cultural and spiritual landscape. Hinduism, with its myriad deities and rituals, is the predominant religion. Buddhism, founded by Gautama Buddha, emphasizes the path to enlightenment. Jainism teaches non-violence and asceticism, while Sikhism, founded by Guru Nanak, promotes equality and service to humanity.
            <br>
            Philosophy and Thought<br>
            Indian philosophy is vast and profound, encompassing various schools of thought. The Vedas and Upanishads form the foundation of Hindu philosophy, exploring concepts like dharma (duty), karma (action), and moksha (liberation). Buddhism and Jainism introduced ideas of non-violence and the middle path. Indian philosophy has influenced global thought, including Western philosophers and modern spiritual movements.
            <br>
            Family Structure and Marriage<br>
            Family is the cornerstone of Indian society. Traditionally, extended families living together were common, but nuclear families are becoming more prevalent in urban areas. Marriages are often arranged by families, considering factors like caste, horoscope, and social status. However, love marriages are increasingly accepted, especially in cities. Indian weddings are grand affairs, filled with rituals, music, and dance.
